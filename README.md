Uses Sign-In-With-Ethereum (SIWE) to derive an Oasis Staking keypair.

This allows for ROSE to be received from `oasis1...` addresses at the consensus
level then transferred to Sapphire without installing the Oasis extension or the
Oasis Web Wallet.

## SIWE Key Derivation

```python
secret = SHA512(SIWE(eip4361Message))
```

This requires [ECDSA] ([RFC-6979]) signing to be deterministic to derive the same key
every time, additionally the Nonce & IssuedAt dates are hard-coded, essentially
everybody is signing the same message to derive 128 bytes of entropy in a way
which can only be generated by the keyholder.

```python
def SIWE(msg):
    h = SHA256(msg)
    k = HMAC256(privateKey, h)
    R = k*G
    return [R.x, k*G, k^-1 * (h + (R.x*privateKey))]
```

The signature can then be used as seed for a key-pair, or used as the root of a
BIP32 HD wallet. Because logging in with the same Ethereum account via
Sign-In-With-Ethereum works consistently across different devices, wallets and
libraries you will login to the same account every time you access the dApp
with that wallet.
